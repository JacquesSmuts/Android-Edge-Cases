# Android-Edge-Cases
This is just a list of all those edge cases I run into and don't think about until it crashes


### Connectivity
- What happens if you lose connection halfway through any api call?

### Screensize
- Does your layout work on small screens?
- Does your layout work on a device with big font?

### Notifications
- Push Notifications are different from Android 8.0 onwards. Test older and newer versions.
